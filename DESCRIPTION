Description: Building upon the workflow developed for Berner et al. 2020 the lsatTS package helps you to: 1) Export time-series for the whole Landsat record based on point coordinates ("sites"). 2) Cross-calibration of Landsat VI time-series to account for sparse observations and sensor differences. 3) Define growing season characteristics such as the maximum NDVI.
