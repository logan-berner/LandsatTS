Description: Building upon the workflow developed for Berner et al. 2020 the lsatTS package helps you to: 1) Export surface reflectance time-series for the whole Landsat record based on point coordinates ("sites"); 2) Clean and cross-calibrate Landsat; and 3) Derive growing season characteristics such as the annual maximum NDVI.
