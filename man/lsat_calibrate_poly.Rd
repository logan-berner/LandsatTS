\title{Cross-calibrate Landsat sensors using polynomial regression}
\usage{
lsat_calibrate_poly(
  dt,
  band.or.si,
  doy.rng = 152:243,
  min.obs = 5,
  train.with.highlat.data = F,
  frac.train = 0.75,
  trim = T,
  overwrite.col = F,
  write.output = T,
  outfile.id = band.or.si,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{Data.table containing the band or spectral index to cross-calibrate.}

\item{band.or.si}{Character string matching the column name of the band or spectral
index to cross-calibrate.}

\item{doy.rng}{Sequence of numbers specifying the Days of Year
to use for model development.}

\item{min.obs}{Minimum number of paired, seasonally-matched observations
from Landsat 7 and Landsat 5/8 required to include a sampling sample.}

\item{train.with.highlat.data}{(True/False) Should the RF models be trained using an
internal high-latitude dataset that sampled the Arctic and Boreal biomes?}

\item{frac.train}{Fraction of samples to use for training the random forest models.
The remaining samples are used for model cross-validation.}

\item{trim}{(True/False) If true, then for each sample site the percent difference
in spectral indices between satellites is determined. The lowest 2.5 and highest 97.5
percentiles are then trimmed. This is meant to reduce potential differences that
are not directly attributable to the sensors, but rather to exogenous factors.}

\item{overwrite.col}{(True/False) Overwrite existing column or (by default)
append cross-calibrated data as a new column?}

\item{write.output}{(True/False) Should RF models and evaluation content be written to disk?
Either way, evaluation table and figure are printed in the console.}

\item{outfile.id}{Identifier used when naming output files. Defaults to the input band,
but can be specified if needed such as when performing Monte Carlo simulations.}

\item{outdir}{Output directory (created if necessary) to which multiple files will be written.
The files include:
(1) fitted random forest models as R objects,
(2) evaluation data in a csv file,
(3) summary of model cross-validation in a csv file, and
(4) multi-panel scatter plot comparing sensors pre- and post-calibration in jpeg format.
If cross-calibrating both Landsat 5 and 8, then the function returns files for both sensors.}

\value{
The input data.table with an appended column titled band.xcal, where "band"
is your specified band or spectral index.

\description{
There are systematic differences in spectral indices (e.g., NDVI) among Landsat 5, 7, and 8
(Landsat Collection 2). It is important to address these differences before assessing temporal
trends in spectral data. Failure to address these differences can, for instance, introduce
artificial positive trends into NDVI time-series that are based on measurements from multiple
Landsat sensors (Ju and Masek 2016, Roy et al. 2016, Berner et al. 2020). This function
cross-calibrates individual bands or spectral indices from Landsat 5/8 to match Landsat 7.
Landsat 7 is used as a benchmark because it temporally overlaps with the other two sensors.
Cross-calibration can only be performed on one band or spectral index at a time. The approach
involves determining the typical reflectance at a sample during a portion of the growing
season site using Landsat 7 and Landsat 5/8 data that were collected the same years.
Polynomial regression models from first to third order are trained to predict Landsat 7 reflectance
from Landsat 5/8 reflectance, the most parsimonious model is selected
using BIC, and then that model is used to cross-calbirate the data.
This approach is most suitable when working with data from 100s to preferably 1000s
of sample samples.

The specific steps to cross-calibrating sensors include:
(1) Identify the years when both Landsat 7 and Landsat 5/8 measured surface reflectance
at a sample sample.
(2) Pool the reflectance measurements across those years and compute 15-day moving median
reflectance over the course of the growing season for each sensor and sampling sample.
(3) Exclude 15-day periods with fewer than a specified number of measurements from both
sets of sensors and then randomly select one remaining 15-day period from each
sample sample.
(4) Split the data into sets for model training and evaluation.
(5) Train polynomial regression models that predict Landsat 7 reflectance based on Landsat 5/8
reflectance. Model order (1st to 3rd) is selected using BIC.
(6) Apply the polynomial regression models to cross-calibrate measurements.

See Berner et al. (2020) for a full description of the approach.
